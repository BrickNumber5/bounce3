# Bounce Rebuild v3

This is the third complete rewrite of the Bounce game, the first version never really worked and was completely scrapped. It was never publicly available. Version 2 is still available at [https://github.com/BrickNumber5/bounce]

There were a variety of reasons I wanted to make a total rewrite, but it primarily comes down to all of the mechanics being so interlinked and non-modular that it was hard to make any changes without doing all sorts of things all over the place
