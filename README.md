# Bounce Rebuild v3

This is the third complete rewrite of the Bounce game, the first version never really worked and was completely scrapped. It was never publicly available. Version 2 is still available at https://github.com/BrickNumber5/bounce

There were a variety of reasons I wanted to make a total rewrite, but it primarily comes down to all of the mechanics being so interlinked and non-modular that it was hard to make any changes without doing all sorts of things all over the place

## Gameplay

The game is controlled using the mouse or touchscreen, click drag and release the fire the player in the opposite direction.
